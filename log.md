- React Hooks Refreshers:
- useLayoutEffect - The signature is identical to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. 99% of the time useEffect is preferred.
- memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
- useCallback gives you referential equality between renders for functions. useMemo gives you referential equality between renders for values.
