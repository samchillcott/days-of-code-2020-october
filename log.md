- React Hooks Refreshers:
- useLayoutEffect - The signature is identical to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. 99% of the time useEffect is preferred.
- memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
- useCallback gives you referential equality between renders for functions. useMemo gives you referential equality between renders for values.

- React Hooks Refreshers:
- useCallback - Prevents a child component from re-rendering when a function is passed as a prop.
- React.memo - Compares the props and if the props have changed then it will re-render the component.
- useMemo - If you have to process a lot of data, 'useMemo' is the perfect Hook as it will do the work once at the first render and then return a cached version on every other render.
- Levels & Ladders - Created public google doc for progression from Junior including benchmarks and tips for each stage. 
- Lambda vs anonymous functions - a lambda function is not necessarily anonymous and an anonymous function is not necessarily a lambda expression if it is not passed around like data.

**Thoughts** 
- I am looking forward to working my way up the levels. Love a roadmap. This will also be the basis for my next OKR run.
